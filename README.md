# LSTM Stock Prediction

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict stock prices based on historical data. LSTM networks are a type of deep learning model particularly well-suited for time series forecasting due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and train an LSTM-based model that can analyze past stock prices and predict future trends. The workflow typically includes:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering historical stock price data.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, normalizing, and structuring the data for model input.
3. **Model Building:** Designing an LSTM RNN architecture using deep learning frameworks.
4. **Training:** Fitting the model to the historical data.
5. **Evaluation:** Assessing prediction accuracy using appropriate metrics.
6. **Prediction:** Using the trained model to forecast future stock prices.

## Tools and Libraries Used

Based on the `requirements.txt` file, the following tools and libraries are used in this project:

- **numpy:** For numerical computations and array operations.
- **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib:** For data visualization and plotting results.
- **scikit-learn:** For preprocessing, splitting data, and evaluation metrics.
- **tensorflow:** For building and training the LSTM neural network.
- **keras:** High-level API for defining and training deep learning models (integrated with TensorFlow).
- **yfinance:** For downloading historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.

## Understanding LSTM RNN

### What is LSTM?

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies. Unlike traditional RNNs, LSTMs are designed to avoid the problem of vanishing or exploding gradients, making them effective for modeling time series data.

### How LSTM Works

- **Memory Cells:** LSTM units contain memory cells that can maintain information in memory for long periods.
- **Gates:** LSTMs use gates (input, forget, and output gates) to control the flow of information, deciding what to keep, update, or discard.
- **Sequential Data:** LSTMs process data in sequences, making them ideal for tasks like stock price prediction where past values influence future outcomes.

### Why Use LSTM for Stock Prediction?

Stock prices are inherently sequential and influenced by historical trends. LSTMs can capture these temporal patterns and dependencies, making them a powerful tool for forecasting future prices based on past data.
